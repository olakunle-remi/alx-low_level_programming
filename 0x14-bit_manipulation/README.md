#task 										#prototype
0.0 Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.		unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);

1.1 Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.		void print_binary(unsigned long int n);

2.10 Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.		int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);

3.11 Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.	int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

4.100 Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.	int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

5.101 Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to	unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m); 
flip to get from one number to another.
